# Test Design

Build tests that derive expectations from authoritative sources, eliminate manual synchronization, and produce actionable diagnostics on failure.

## Core Principle

**Never let a test's expected value depend on human memory.**

If a test hardcodes a value that also exists in source code, configuration, or a schema, the test is a synchronization point. When either side changes independently, the test lies — it either passes when it shouldn't, or fails without revealing which side is wrong.

## Decision Framework

Before writing an assertion, answer three questions:

### 1. Where is the source of truth?

| Source of Truth | Import It | Example |
|----------------|-----------|---------|
| Code constant | `import { X }` | `STEP_PHASE`, enum values |
| Schema file | Read and parse | JSON Schema `required` fields |
| Config file | Read and parse | `steps_registry.json` step definitions |
| Design doc | `@design_ref` tag | Allowed intents from design |

If the answer is "my head" or "the PR description", the test will rot.

### 2. What is the relationship being tested?

Test **relationships** (properties/invariants), not **specific values**.

```typescript
// Bad: hardcoded expectation
assertEquals(phases.length, 4);

// Good: relationship — every STEP_PHASE value is accepted by config
const missing = Object.values(STEP_PHASE).filter(p => !pattern.test(p));
assertEquals(missing.length, 0);
```

### 3. When this fails, will the developer know what to fix?

Error messages must state:
- What is mismatched (with both sides named)
- Which file(s) to fix
- IF/THEN guidance when multiple fixes are valid

## Test Patterns

### Contract Test (Layer 1)

Verify that a consumer's requirements are met by a provider. Import the consumer's declaration as source of truth.

```
Source of truth:  Module A (declares requirements)
Test target:      Config/Module B (must satisfy them)
Error guidance:   "Fix B to satisfy A" (one direction)
```

When to use: An implementation module **hardcodes** a dependency on a value that a configuration or another module must provide.

See `references/patterns.md` for implementation details.

### Conformance Test (Layer 2)

Verify mutual consistency between two peer configurations. Neither is the sole source of truth — both must agree.

```
Source A:  steps_registry.json (declares c2/c3 values)
Source B:  user.yml (declares accepted patterns)
Error guidance:  IF/THEN for both directions
```

When to use: Two config files that must stay in sync, but either could be the one that changed.

See `references/patterns.md` for implementation details.

### Invariant Test

Verify a property that must always hold, regardless of specific values.

```typescript
// Invariant: every step in registry must have a prompt file
for (const [id, step] of Object.entries(registry.steps)) {
  const path = `${base}/${step.c2}/${step.c3}/f_${step.edition ?? "default"}.md`;
  assert(await exists(path), `Missing prompt file for step "${id}": ${path}`);
}
```

When to use: A structural relationship must hold across all members of a collection.

## Validator as Test Boundary

When a validator exists, the test's responsibility shifts (検証責任の転換):

```
Without validator:  Test → Config ↔ Code  (test directly checks consistency)
With validator:     Test → Validator → Config  (test verifies validator behavior)
```

Four aspects to verify: **Acceptance** (valid input passes) / **Rejection** (invalid input caught) / **Diagnosis** (error message actionable) / **Completeness** (all design constraints covered).

Existing patterns apply: Contract → validator rejects what code cannot handle. Invariant → every design constraint has a validation rule. Conformance → accepted values match runtime support.

See `references/patterns.md` for implementation examples and the Validator Bypass anti-pattern.

## Diagnosability

### Theory

Diagnosability (診断可能性): "a test failure is diagnosable if the failure message alone is sufficient to identify the fix" (Microsoft Research). Gerard Meszaros『xUnit Test Patterns』では Defect Localization として体系化。

テストの失敗メッセージだけで修正先が分かるかどうかが、テスト品質の基礎指標となる。

### Test Pattern Determines Message Structure

テストパターンの選択がエラーメッセージの構造まで決定する:

| Pattern | Fault type | Message structure |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Contract Test | Unambiguous — provider must conform | `Fix:` single directive |
| Conformance Test | Ambiguous — either side could be wrong | `IF/THEN` branching |
| Invariant Test | Unambiguous — the violating member is wrong | `Fix:` with specific member ID |

Contract Test では修正先が一意（provider が consumer に合わせる）なので `Fix:` 形式。Conformance Test では一意に決まらない（どちらの変更が意図的か不明）なので IF/THEN で開発者の意図に委ねる。

### Message Requirements

Every assertion message must contain:

1. **What** — the mismatch, with concrete values from both sides
2. **Where** — file paths of both sides
3. **How to fix** — `Fix:` (single direction) or `IF/THEN` (ambiguous fault)

For full message templates and examples, see `references/patterns.md`.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| Hardcoded expected list | Manual sync required when source changes | Import from source of truth |
| Magic number assertion | `assertEquals(x, 4)` — why 4? | Derive from authoritative definition |
| Manual subset selection | `[A, B, C]` cherry-picked from a larger set | `Object.values(SOURCE)` for full coverage |
| Silent pass on empty | Loop over empty collection passes vacuously | Assert collection is non-empty first |
| Opaque failure | `assert(false)` with no context | Include file paths and IF/THEN guidance |
| Partial consumer enumeration | Contract の消費者が複数あるのにテストが一部しか検査しない | 全ての消費箇所を列挙してからテストを書く |
| Shadow contract | パラメータ化された経路をバイパスするハードコード値 | ハードコード値をパラメータに置換し、非デフォルト値で回帰テスト |
| Validator bypass | validator が存在するのにテストが設定を直接検証する | validator の動作をテストする; 検証責任は validator にある |

See `references/patterns.md` for detailed explanations of these anti-patterns.

## Workflow

0. **Check for existing validator** — if a validator covers this constraint, test the validator's behavior, not the constraint directly
1. **Identify the invariant** — what relationship must always hold?
2. **Locate the source of truth** — which module/file authoritatively defines the expectation?
3. **Enumerate all consumers** — the invariant を消費する全てのコードパスを洗い出す (steps, validationSteps, retry paths, etc.)
4. **Import, don't copy** — derive expected values from the source
5. **Choose the pattern** — Contract (one-way) or Conformance (two-way)?
6. **Write the assertion** — test the relationship, not a specific value
7. **Craft the error message** — include What/Where/How-to-fix
8. **Verify non-vacuity** — ensure the test exercises real data
9. **Hunt shadow contracts** — grep for hardcoded values that bypass the parameterized path

# Task Closure

Finalize and summarize the completed work.

## Instructions

1. Verify all changes are committed (`git status --porcelain` must be empty)
2. Summarize all completed work in `summary` field
3. Return `closing` intent to complete

## Boundary Hook

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT execute boundary actions directly (e.g., `gh issue close`).

When you return `closing` intent, the **Boundary Hook** will automatically execute any configured boundary actions (closing issues, merging PRs, etc.).

Your role is to verify conditions and return structured output only.

## Intent Guide

- Use `closing` to complete the workflow
- Use `repeat` to retry closure validation if something is not ready
